## Platform

These programs were built for the Texas Instruments 83+/84 graphing calculator (black and white edition). They were made with [Axe Parser](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/456/45659.html), a low-level language syntactically similar to TI-BASIC but compiled into much faster binaries with graphics, grayscale support, multiplayer functionality, and more.
